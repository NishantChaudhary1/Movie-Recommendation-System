# **Movie Recommendation Project**

This is my *capstone project* of the *"Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals"* specialization which in offered by Duke University on [Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-recommender)

## Run this project [HERE!](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//capstone/recommender.php?id=xqsLtSbzOkCgjA)
> The interface is offered by Duke University.


<b>I recommend movies based on the similarity of ratings the user gave and those of professional raters gave on IDMB, which is to say, you are more likely to share taste with the raters who rate movies like you do. Then what movies to be recommeded are those the similar raters think very highly of.</b>

## Steps:
1. Read in and parse move and rating data into lists and maps.
2. Calculate average ratings.
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings.
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings.
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.

## Working of Project:
1. User is asked to rate certain number of movies, these rating will be used to make recommendation for the user.
