This is my *capstone project* of the *"Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals"* specialization which in offered by Duke University on Coursera.

1. Read in and parse move and rating data into lists and maps.
2. Calculate average ratings.
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings.
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings.
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.
